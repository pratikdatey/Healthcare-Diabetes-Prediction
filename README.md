# Healthcare-Diabetes-Prediction

- Problem Statement - The objective of this project was to create a model who predicts patient is Diabetic or not.   

- Description  - Applying Classification and Ensembles technique to get the best model with best accuracy. Initial Best Accuracy is 65% with Random Forest Classifier. After Data Pre-processing, EDA and finding best Hyperparameter the best  model is Random Forest Classifier with 80% accuracy with improved precision, Recall and F1 score.

- Libraries/Tools - Python(Jupyter Notebook), Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Imblearn.
